Do you want to get more out of your regular exercises? Add some resistance to it. In the sequence below, we will explore Tabata with water bottles or small weights. Remember, it will still be a lot of cardio, so do not overdo it with weigth. Some of the exercises will be done with and some without the weigths. Indication to include weights will be in the brackets.
