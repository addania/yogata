Hello lovely people of the sports group <code>Fit am Dienstag</code>. After a longer time I prepared a yoga class for you again. In these precarious times let`s boost our immunity system to be better equiped to combat various challenges in our lives. I cherry-picked some yoga postures which bring about well-being and stimulate our immunity, as well as those which will elevate our heart rate and strengthen our bodies. We will do back bends, inversions, twists and more.
