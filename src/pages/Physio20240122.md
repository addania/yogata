My entire life has been plagued by frequent migraines, which I now suspect may be attributed to issues in my neck. I've also been experiencing lower back pain and a tingling sensation from my fingers up to my shoulder lately.

I made a little bit of a research on the tingling issue and based on these absolutely wonderful videos (by Princeton Spine & Joint Center and by Bob & Brad), I discovered that my symptoms might be related to a pinched nerve and can be treated with exercises:

2. [Bob & Brad Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RKExEIslZw&ab_channel=Bob%26Brad)

I started to go for the physiotherapy and here I aim to document my physio routine and some other materials which I find valuable. So far I can only testify that this routine helps me reduce migraine occurrences or decrease pain severity. Continuing the practise I hope to alleviate the tingling and also the lower back pain.

11. Do the same as above, but instead of moving on the shoulder level, do semi circles. start on the level of your hips, then circle to the left side, but go above your shoulder height, then lower it in circular motion to the hips and continue all the way to the right, again above your shoulder height
12. Drop the stick. interlace your finger in front of your head, stretch out your arms towards the sky. do circular motions with your arms.
