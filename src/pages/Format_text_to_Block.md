Are you also one of those perfectionists (like me..) who like their text to be nicely formatted in a <code>BLOCK</code>, rather than having each text line of different length? If yes, then this article is for you!

In order to have each line of text of same length and left and right side of text nicely aligned, we can use following code:
```
<p style={{  textAlign: "justify" }}>
```

Try it out! It works like magic :)
