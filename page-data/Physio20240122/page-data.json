I've also been experiencing lower back pain and a tingling sensation from my fingers up to my shoulder lately.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4AZRU85.png\" title=\"Photo by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels\"><p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: right\"><em>Photo by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels</em></p></p>\n<p>I made a little bit of a research on the tingling issue and based on these absolutely wonderful videos (by Princeton Spine &#x26; Joint Center and by Bob &#x26; Brad), I discovered that my symptoms might be related to a pinched nerve and can be treated with exercises:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNI6qiv0iyo&#x26;ab_channel=PrincetonSpine%26JointCenter\">Princeton Spine &#x26; Joint Center Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RKExEIslZw&#x26;ab_channel=Bob%26Brad\">Bob &#x26; Brad Video</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I started to go for the physiotherapy and here I aim to document my physio routine and some other materials which I find valuable. So far I can only testify that this routine helps me reduce migraine occurrences or decrease pain severity. Continuing the practise I hope to alleviate the tingling and also the lower back pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Laying down</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M9B911b.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Elina Fairytale from Pexels\"><p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: right\"><em>Photo by Elina Fairytale from Pexels</em></p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lay on your back, stretch out your legs, point toes away on inhale, and flex fingers towards you on exhale.</li>\n<li>Lay on your back, rotate feet outwards on inhale, and do inner rotation on exhale.</li>\n<li>Bend knees, drop left knee to the left on inhale, bring it back on exhale; repeat on the right.</li>\n<li>Repeat above with both knees simultaneously.</li>\n<li>Rotate both knees to the left on inhale, bring them back up, then rotate to the right on exhale.</li>\n<li>Push hips up on inhale, drop hips on exhale.</li>\n<li>Open and close legs with hips lifted.</li>\n<li>Lay on your back, stretch out your legs, hold a stick in your hands shoulder width apart. start your holding the stick at your hips level, then bring it above your head on the ground, try touching it to the ground</li>\n<li>Same as above but do full circles with your arms and the stick from your hips, to the right, above your head, to the left and so on. change the direction</li>\n<li>Same as above but take the stick to the left side of your body on the shoulder height and then transfer it in front of you to the right. try to touch the ground on the right with the stick. then go back to the left side. all the time keep both hands on the stick</li>\n<li>Do the same as above, but instead of moving on the shoulder level, do semi circles. start on the level of your hips, then circle to the left side, but go above your shoulder height, then lower it in circular motion to the hips and continue all the way to the right, again above your shoulder height</li>\n<li>Drop the stick. interlace your finger in front of your head, stretch out your arms towards the sky. do circular motions with your arms.
